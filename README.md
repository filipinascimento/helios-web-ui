# Helios-web UI

This React component provides a settings drawer for a helios-web visualization tool, allowing users to adjust and interact with various features of the network. It leverages the @mui/material library for UI components and integrates with an existing helios object for updates.

# Setup

2. npm run dev (run just the UI component)
